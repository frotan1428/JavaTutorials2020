        1. Arithmetic Operators: They are used to performing simple arithmetic operations on primitive data types.

            * : Multiplication
            / : Division
            % : Modulo
            + : Addition
            – : Subtraction

         2. Unary Operators:Unary operators need only one operand. They are used  increment,
             decrement or negate a value.
             ++ : Increment operator
             Post-Increment: Value is first used for computing the result and then incremented.
             Pre-Increment: Value is incremented first, and then the result is computed.

             — : Decrement operator, used for decrementing the value by 1.
                 There are two varieties of decrement operators.
                 Post-decrement: Value is first used for computing the result and then decremented.
                 Pre-Decrement: Value is decremented first, and then the result is computed.

                 !  Logical not operator, used for inverting a boolean value.
                  Compound Statement
                  a=+5  or write a+=5

                    &&, Logical AND: returns true when both conditions are true. multiply
                    ||, Logical OR: returns true if at least one condition is true. ADD
